## neural-nils

I am a neuroscientist, genomics scientist/bioinformatician and ML enthusiast.

I am passionate about the intersection, where biology/biomedical science and computer science meet.

Although I have always been programming, I did a lot of research in cellular neuroscience.
I obtained a deep knowledge of molecular biology (e.g. CRISPR) and neuroscience.

However, I realized that computers are the way to go to truly understand biology. 

Demis Hassabis is summarizing my belief in this quote very well: 
>"But of course, life is a very complex process and it's an emergent process. And I think because of that, it's pretty difficult to describe mathematically in a kind of clean way. Like, if you think about trying to describe a whole cell, is there ever going to be a Newton's laws of motion for a cell? I don't think so. I think it's too complicated and it's too emergent. So in a way, it could be the perfect regime for AI to operate in. And I think as maths is to physics, maths is like the perfect description language for physics, I think AI could be the perfect description language for biology. And I hope that AlphaFold will be not just useful in itself, but also kind of proof of concept of maybe a heralding of a new dawn of what I call and others call digital biology." [[1]](1)

Therefore, to understand biology, I need to understand the ultimate tool to tackle it, artificial intelligence.
And this is what I try to do as best as I can.

It is also my hope, that biological intuition can help building the next generation of AI systems.

Some of my interests:  
 - genomics
 - bioinformatics
 - neuroscience
 - machine learning to understand neuroscience / drug discovery
 - alphafold
 - complexity of biological systems

I am also very interested in / do some hobbying in: 
 - decentralized systems
 - cryptography
 - financial data
 - fundamentals of deep learning/calculus

I mostly code in Python and R, but I also really like C++.
My ML experiments are mostly done in Pytorch.
However, when I am trying to thoroughly understand an ML mechanism I try implementing it in python numpy to really understand the matrix operations and the calculus that is happening under the hood.

I am planning to put some tutorials online, to share my knowledge about fundamentals of ML.
