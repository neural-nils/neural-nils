## neural-nils

I am a neuroscientist, genomics scientist/bioinformatician and ML practitioner.

I am passionate about the intersection, where biology/biomedical science and computer science meet.

Some of my favorite topics:  
 - genomics
 - bioinformatics
 - neuroscience
 - machine learning to understand neuroscience / drug discovery
 - alphafold

I am also very interested in / do some hobbying in: 
 - decentralized systems
 - cryptography
 - financial data
 - fundamentals of deep learning/calculus

I mostly code in Python and R, but I also really like C++.
My ML experiments are mostly done in Pytorch, except when I try to reinvent the wheel (then I am mostly using python numpy).

I am planning to put some tutorials online, to share my knowledge about fundamentals of ML.
